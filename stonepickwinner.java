 consisting of
N
 positive integers. Taro and Jiro will play the following game against each other.

Initially, we have a pile consisting of
K
 stones. The two players perform the following operation alternately, starting from Taro:

Choose an element
x
 in
A
, and remove exactly
x
 stones from the pile.
A player loses when he becomes unable to play. Assuming that both players play optimally, determine the winner.

Input 1

2 4
2 3
Output 1
First
    If Taro removes three stones, Jiro cannot make a move. Thus, Taro wins.
