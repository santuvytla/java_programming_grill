    /*
    if in the input the randomised values are to be taken then we call it as randomised algorithm
    if you toss the coin to get tail how many times on average will u toss the coin.
    if we get tail then we win immediately then no of tosses are 1...so 1/2*1+1/4*2+1/8*3.....=2(we call expected value)..th main idea is repeating the process for the
    number of times increases the prob that it happends atleast once


  shuffle an array take two for loops for i 0 to n then j should be random number rand%(i+1)..that means 0 to i...and swap the array elements.
